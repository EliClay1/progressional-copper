Progressional - Copper
====
Progressional - Copper is a minecraft mod designed to overhaul the current progression system. I found that while copper tools are cool, they are completely and entirely useless. So I decided to take this concern into my own hands. 

## So what changes does this *currently make?

- Completely removes all the original iron crafting recipes
- Adds an upgrade template to convert copper tools into iron
- Adds a new advancement to show this progression
- Removes all iron pickaxes from chests

You can Find, craft, or kill for the Iron Template, so feel free to use your favorite recipe browsing mod, or refer to the spoiler below. In order to kill for it, it has been added as a 15% drop chance from **Armorer**, **Toolsmith**, and **Weaponsmith** villagers.

Feel free to leave any comments on changes you would like to see, and I hope this adds a little boost of progression to your next playthrough!



**NOTICE**: This is the first of many progressional mods that will be created. Copper is phase one, but I have plans to redo the entire progression system. Additionally, config modifications to forge the mod into what you want it to be will be released in the next version.



\*_currently_ because there will be updates that shift loot tables more, as well as remove certain trades from villagers and various other changes like world gen. In the mean time, all of that is in development.
